# Smark


Smark is a markdown generation library in typesafe way

dupa

Do not take this project seriously, first of all I wanted to learn some mechanisms from Scala 3

## Usage


Add the following to your build.sbt:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "halotukozak" %% "smark" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

Then you can use Smark in your Scala 3 project:

```scala
import halotukozak.smark.typography.*

markdown {
heading[1]("Smark")
  paragraph {
    text[Normal]("Smark is a markdown generation library in typesafe way")
    quote[Important]("Do not take this project seriously, first of all I wanted to learn some mechanisms from Scala 3")
 }
}
```

will generate:

```
# Smark


Smark is a markdown generation library in typesafe way

> [!Important]
> Do not take this project seriously, first of all I wanted to learn some mechanisms from Scala 3
```

If you prefer to skip brackets, you can use the following syntax:

```scala
import halotukozak.smark.typography.*

markdown:
  heading[1]("Smark")
  paragraph:
    text[Normal]("Smark is a markdown generation library in typesafe way")
    quote[Important]("Do not take this project seriously, first of all I wanted to learn some mechanisms from Scala 3")

```

## Main Scala features used in Smark

### Context Functions


```scala
def table(init: Table ?=> MdUnit)(using m: MdElement): MdUnit
```

takes a parameter which operates on the Table instance what enables a syntax like this:

```scala

               |table {
               |  header("column1", "column2")
               |  row {
               |    cell("row1column1")
               |    cell("row1column2")
               |  }
               |  row {
               |    cell("row2column1")
               |    cell("row2column2")
               |  }
               |}
               |
```
